# Minishell Project:

Minishell is a project assigned by the 42 school, which aims to create a simple shell. \
A shell is a program that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands, \
in addittion this project requires the implementation of several features, including:

&nbsp;  • Reading and parsing commands entered by the user. \
&nbsp;  • Handling built-in commands (such as cd, echo, and env). \
&nbsp;  • Managing environment variables. \
&nbsp;  • Executing external commands.

# Getting Started:
&nbsp;  • First: clone our Repo \
&nbsp; &nbsp; `git clone git@github.com:AhmedAlfahal/minishell.git` \
&nbsp;  • Second: go to minishell directory.  \
&nbsp; &nbsp; `cd minishell` \
&nbsp;  • Third: Compile it. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; `make` \
&nbsp;   •Last: Enjoy shelling ;) \
&nbsp; &nbsp; `./minishell`

# Features:

&nbsp;  • Reading and Parsing Commands: The shell reads commands entered \
&nbsp; &nbsp; by the user and parses them into tokens. It supports various types of tokens, \
&nbsp; &nbsp; such as quotes, escapes, and redirections.

&nbsp;  • Built-in Commands: The shell supports built-in commands, such as cd, echo, env, exit, and pwd.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; These commands are implemented within the shell and do not require  executing external commands.

&nbsp;  • Environment Variables: The shell allows the user to manage environment variables, including \
&nbsp; &nbsp; setting new variables, deleting variables, and printing all variables.

&nbsp;  • External Commands: The shell can execute external commands by creating \
&nbsp; &nbsp; a child process and executing the command within the child process. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; It supports various types of external commands, such as programs \
&nbsp; &nbsp; installed on the system and custom scripts.

# Conclusion:
&nbsp;   Overall, the Minishell project provides an opportunity to gain a deeper \
&nbsp;   understanding of the inner workings of a shell and to practice working with \
&nbsp;   low-level programming concepts. By completing this project, you'll have a solid \
&nbsp;   foundation in shell programming that will be useful for further learning and exploration.
